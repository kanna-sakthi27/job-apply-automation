# jaabz.md — Jaabz channel body (prepended by prompts/_shared.md)

You are the Jaabz DevOps auto-apply run for the candidate.

## What Jaabz is (verified 2026-09-07)
jaabz.com is a visa-sponsorship / relocation / remote tech job board. Its **"Apply Now" is an OUTBOUND
link to the real posting** — usually the same role on LinkedIn (`linkedin.com/jobs/view/...`), sometimes
the employer's own ATS. Jaabz does not host applications: use it as the lead source, apply on the
destination, then click **Mark Applied** on the Jaabz job page.
the candidate's Jaabz account is logged in in Brave (header "Alagartnam S...").
**If the Jaabz header shows "Sign In", or LinkedIn redirects to /login/, both sessions are gone — stop
immediately, report "needs login", and do not scan hubs.** (This wasted a whole run on 2026-09-19.)

## Discovery
Hubs (server-rendered, real filters):
`https://jaabz.com/jobs/devops/visasponsorship` · `/jobs/devops/relocation` · `/jobs/devops/remote` ·
`/jobs/in/<country>/visasponsorship` (united-kingdom, canada, germany, …).
Do NOT rely on `?query=` filters on `/jobs` — the SPA ignores them.
Read job cards with one compact DOM eval (title link → `/jobs/<id>-<slug>`); open each job in a NEW
labelled tab; read the apply link `a[title='Apply now']` to decide routing.
Jaabz cards show experience levels (Associate / Not Applicable / Entry) — skip junior/mid-only.

## Per-job flow
1. Open the job page; verify in-scope title/company/country + description, no below-floor band, and not
   already in the injected PREFLIGHT already-applied list (same company + similar title anywhere = SKIP).
2. Read the Apply Now href:
   - `linkedin.com/jobs/view` → LinkedIn Easy Apply if offered. Gotchas: the Easy Apply modal is a plain
     div, detect it by "Apply to <Company>"; React #418 → reload + retry; click the real `input` centre
     for radios; page order varies; watch for the draft-save interstitial.
   - Employer ATS → apply per the ATS family. Greenhouse / Lever / Ashby / SmartRecruiters guest+Google
     apply OK. Workday / SuccessFactors / Taleo account+OTP → skip unless Google SSO. Captcha → skip.
     Never invent a password.
3. Count as applied ONLY on the confirmation ("Your application was submitted" / "We've received your
   application"). Then append the row to `jaabz-automation/answers.md` §6
   (`date | title @ company, country | applied | submitted-OK (via Jaabz -> <destination>)`), append to
   `applied-jobs-registry.md` (channel = jaabz), and click Mark Applied on the Jaabz tab
   (`button.applied-toggle[data-job-id]`; verify it turns active "Applied").
4. Mid-form wall (unanswerable required question / captcha / form bug after 3 attempts) → SKIP + log and
   continue. Never park a needs-review draft.

## Efficiency note
This channel repeatedly re-probes the same dead leads (Piper = govtech Secret clearance, fullstack roles
with Python, and duplicates of postings already applied the same day). Check the injected PREFLIGHT
list and skip those in one glance rather than probing them again.
